# DrawMeSomeCards
A lot of practice projects involve card games like Blackjack.  I wanted a prettier way to display the hands my user was drawing.  

So far you can:
1. Create a deck of 52 playing cards
2. Display a card to the command line (hearts and diamonds will display with red icons/text)

To-Do:
1. Decide whether multiple-card hands should be displayed feathered out or in a line
2. Write methods to easily display full hands of cards
